Cat Cafe Team

### Introduction
Project 5 is the first of three deliverables for your Semester Project. The plan right now is as follows:
  - Project 5 – the Project Design deliverables – will be due on Wed 3/30 – worth 100 points (with possible bonus)
    - This part of the project is detailed below
  - Project 6 – the first Semester Project Sprint is due Wed 4/13 – worth 75 points
    - This will be an interim submission including an in-person demonstration and review to show where the project code stands after your first two weeks of code development
    - Expect to deliver at least 50% of the functionality of your code here
  - Project 7 – the second/final Semester Project Sprint is due Wed 4/27 – worth 100 points (with possible bonus)
    - This is the final delivery of your project code and support with recorded demonstrations
  - Note that Projects 5, 6, and 7 are not divided into Part 1 and 2 deliveries – one delivery per  project

### The Semester Project
Create a non-trivial set of classes and services that make use of some of the design patterns we cover to provide a nice set of functionalities to an end-user; we like to see some UI design, business logic, and data handling (MVC?), but your project may vary per your proposed topic. You may use any languages, 
frameworks, libraries, or utilities for your project as long as the project demonstrates object-oriented design.
